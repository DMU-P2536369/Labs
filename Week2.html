    <h1 style="color:red">Dogs Become Valuable Employees at Bank</h1>
    <p style="color:white">It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank has <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic data-entry tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier today a spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with the <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were just happy to be involved.</p>
